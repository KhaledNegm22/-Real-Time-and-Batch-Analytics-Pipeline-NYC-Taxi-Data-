# üöñ Hybrid Real-Time & Batch Data Pipeline (NYC Taxi Data)

## üìå Overview
This project demonstrates a **hybrid real-time and batch data pipeline** for processing, analyzing, and visualizing **NYC Taxi trip data** (Yellow & Green cabs).  

The pipeline was built to:
- Stream and process live taxi trip data every 2 minutes.  
- Perform transformations and aggregations in real-time.  
- Store data for both **real-time analytics (Cosmos DB)** and **batch analytics (Snowflake)**.  
- Visualize insights such as **trip patterns**, **vendor performance**, and **congestion trends** using **Power BI**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Azure Function** ‚Üí Acts as a producer, fetching 100 Yellow & 100 Green taxi trip rows every 2 minutes from **Blob Storage** and sending them to **Event Hub**.  
- **Azure Event Hub** ‚Üí Message broker for streaming data between producer and consumer.  
- **Azure Stream Analytics** ‚Üí Real-time data processing & transformations; sends data to **Cosmos DB** and **Blob Storage**.  
- **Azure Blob Storage** ‚Üí Holds both raw and transformed data:  
  - *Snowflake container* (for transformed data)  
  - *Dropped container* (for failed records)  
- **Event Grid + Storage Queue + Snowpipe** ‚Üí Automates loading transformed files into the **Snowflake** staging area.  
- **Snowflake** ‚Üí Stores cleaned and merged data for **batch analytics** using scheduled merge tasks.  
- **Cosmos DB** ‚Üí Stores real-time transformed data for immediate dashboard updates.  
- **Power BI** ‚Üí Visualizes both **real-time (Cosmos DB)** and **batch-time (Snowflake)** analytics.

## üîÑ Data Pipeline

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Ingestion
- **Azure Function** retrieves files from **Blob Storage** every 2 minutes.  
- Sends mixed Yellow & Green taxi data (100 rows each) to **Event Hub**.  

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Real-Time Stream Processing
- **Azure Stream Analytics** consumes messages from **Event Hub**.  
- Performs transformations (cleaning, aggregation, schema standardization).  
- Outputs results to:  
  - **Cosmos DB** ‚Üí For real-time dashboards.  
  - **Transformed Blob Container** ‚Üí For further batch processing.  

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Batch Loading & Transformation
- **Event Grid** triggers **Snowpipe** when new files land in the transformed container.  
- **Snowpipe** loads data into a **staging area** inside **Snowflake**.  
- A **merge task** runs every minute to update the **fact table** from staging.  

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Analytics Layer
- **Batch Analytics (Snowflake ‚Üí Power BI):**  
  - Total Tip Amount per Vendor  
  - Weekly Revenue Trends per Vendor  
  - Payment Type Distribution  
  - Avg Revenue with vs without Congestion Fee  
  - Top 3 Pickup Zones  
  - Trip Count by Borough  

- **Real-Time Analytics (Cosmos DB ‚Üí Power BI):**  
  - Total Trips by Hour  
  - Avg Trip Duration per Hour  
  - Most Congested Pickup Areas in the Last Hour  
  - Highest Revenue Hour in the Last Day

## üìä Example Dashboards
**Batch Analysis Dashboard (Snowflake):**  
- Vendor revenue trends  
- Congestion fee impact on fares  
- Top pickup & drop-off zones  

**Real-Time Dashboard (Cosmos DB):**  
- Live trip count by hour  
- Dynamic map of top pickup zones (last 60 minutes)  
- Live revenue updates per vendor

## üöÄ How to Run
1Ô∏è‚É£ Upload **Yellow & Green Taxi CSV** files into **Azure Blob Storage**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy the **Azure Function** to fetch and stream data into **Event Hub**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure **Azure Stream Analytics** to process the stream and write to **Cosmos DB** & **Blob Storage**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Set up **Snowpipe + Event Grid** for automatic loading into **Snowflake**.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ Connect **Power BI** to both **Cosmos DB** (for real-time) and **Snowflake** (for batch).  
6Ô∏è‚É£ Build dashboards to visualize insights.

## üí° Future Improvements
- Implement **Data Quality Monitoring** using **Azure Monitor**.  
- Introduce **incremental refresh** and **auto-scaling** for large datasets.  
- Add **geospatial heatmaps** in **Power BI** for pickup/drop-off visualization.
